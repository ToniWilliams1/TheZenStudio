										<h4>Left &amp; Right</h4>
										<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/" alt="" /></span>I’m Brandon- aka your newest friend, the guy with the eye. I am so grateful that you found yourself here on my site. Whether you saw my art plastered on an NYC street, or referred by a friend, I'm glad you found interest in my work. I'm portrait photographer based in the New York City Metropolitan Area. I've been shooting since I was in high school. My dedication to finding the Top Shot drives me to photograph the beauty of the human experience in its truest, rawest form. Each client has inspired me to do the very thing I do- capture and create. I want to capture your story, because it deserves to be known and celebrated! I've grown to know this about myself when it comes to photography: my favorite style is a blend of documentary & journalism... the kind that takes you back and makes you feel apart of the moment the photo was actually captured in. The type that TELLS A STORY… your story. I love capturing the type of images that really capture YOU, because every love story and person is unique and beautifully made. And I want to be your friend while I capture these kind of images for you. This is not about getting the perfect instagram photo or editing the heck out of the images or the perfect pose, this is about you and your love. I am here to serve you in this way. In fact, I LIVE for it. I’m a little biased, but I think that means that I actually have the BEST job on earth. </span>
